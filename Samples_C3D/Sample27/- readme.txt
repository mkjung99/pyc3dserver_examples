is stored using the TYPE 3 (8 channel KISTLER) force plate description and can be processed in the
same way as standard TYPE-3 data.

Note that the files have FORCE_PLATFORM:ORIGIN information with the force platform origin is stored
as a positive value, potentially implying that the mechanical origin of the force plateform is above
the surface of the force plate.
